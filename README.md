<h3>Hammers fix everything, even permalinks</h3>

<p>A common issue with WordPress is published pages returning 404. This plugin is intended to be a temporary solution until the underlying cause can be isolated. Please note, ALL 404 occurences will trigger this function and be noted in the error log, not just published pages. If the admin email becomes a nuisance, please delete or comment out line 38</p>
